# Ansible Role: Varnish

An Ansible Role that installs Varnish on RHEL/CentOS 6.x.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `vars/main.yml`):

    varnish_config_path: /etc/varnish

The path in which Varnish configuration files will be stored.

    varnish_use_default_vcl: true

Whether to use the included (simplistic) default Varnish VCL, using the backend host/port defined with the next two variables. Set this to `false` and copy your own `default.vcl` file into the `varnish_config_path` if you'd like to use a more complicated setup. If this variable is set to `true`, all other configuration will be taken from Varnish's own [default VCL](https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/browser/bin/varnishd/default.vcl?rev=3.0).

    varnish_default_backend_host: "127.0.0.1"
    varnish_default_backend_port: "8080"

Some settings for the default "default.vcl" template that will be copied to the `varnish_config_path` folder. The default backend host/port could be Apache or Nginx (or some other HTTP server) running on the same host or some other host (in which case, you might use port 80 instead).

    varnish_listen_port: "80"

The port on which Varnish will listen (typically port 80).

    varnish_secret: "14bac2e6-1e34-4770-8078-974373b76c90"

The secret/key to be used for connecting to Varnish's admin backend (for purge requests, etc.).

    varnish_admin_listen_host: "127.0.0.1"
    varnish_admin_listen_port: "6082"

The host and port through which Varnish will accept admin requests (like purge and status requests).

## Dependencies
